  MSIProductVersion is defined in WorkerService.wixproj as 0.0.1 for local desktop builds.  
  You should pass in the MSBuild Property 'MSIProductVersion' to override it during an automated build.
  See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa370859%28v=vs.85%29.aspx for information on allowable values.
  
  The Product@Id attribute (ProductCode Property) will be a random GUID for each build.  This is to support "Major Upgrades" where each install 
  is a seamless uninstall/reinstall.
